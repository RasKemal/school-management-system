# School Management System
A project built in C Programming Language that organises and manages school system.

In this project I used file operations and relational database.

Think of files as tables in the database.

This project runs on terminal.

If you want to understand more about the source code and how to enter inputs,
check out DOCUMENTATION.docx file.

Open the source_code.c in any IDE that supports C Language and you're good to go!

(Remember, all the files that are included in repo need to be in the same folder.)
